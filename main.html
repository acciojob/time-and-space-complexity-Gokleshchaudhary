    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps us to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory space required by the algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
