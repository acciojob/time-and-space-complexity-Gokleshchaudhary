    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is important to design algorithms that are efficient in terms of time complexity.</p>
    
    <b>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. For instance, a common space complexity notation is O(n), which indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</b>
