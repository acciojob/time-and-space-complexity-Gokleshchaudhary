    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It is essential for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms.</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory it requires relative to the input size. For example, a space complexity of O(n) indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
